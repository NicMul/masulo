# Installation

If you haven't already installed Node.js (15+) on your machine, please download
and install the [latest node version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

It's also recommended that you install the 
[node package manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/) for easy installation 
of Node.js packages from the command line.


### 1. Install Next.js

Run the follow command in terminal to instal the latest version of Next:

npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest


### 2. Install Packages

Open up a terminal window and navigate into the website folder in 
your project, then run the following command:

npm install

This will install the packages for you.


### 3. Start Next.js

Run the following command in terminal:

npm run dev

Then navigate to http://localhost:4000 and you will see the website template.
